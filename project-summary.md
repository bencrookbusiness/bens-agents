# Ben's Office - Project Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ What I'm Building

**Ben's Office** - A visual interface for managing AI agents and workflows. Think of it as a "dashboard" that connects external AI workflows (n8n, Zapier, custom APIs) into a simple office metaphor:

- **Offices** â†’ Different workspaces
- **Departments** â†’ Groups of related agents  
- **Agents** â†’ Individual AI workflows triggered via webhooks

### Key Features
- Multiple trigger types: Click, Chat, Upload, Automatic, None
- Flexible return types: None, Text, Chat responses
- Real-time webhook integration
- Future: 2D sprite visualization with PixiJS

## âœ… What's Been Done

### âœ… Core Infrastructure
- React + TypeScript + Vite project setup
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui design system
- Supabase database with RLS security
- TanStack Query for state management

### âœ… Database Schema
- `offices` table - workspace containers
- `departments` table - agent groupings with positions
- `agents` table - webhook endpoints with trigger/return types
- Row Level Security policies for user data isolation

### âœ… UI Components Built
- **Office Floor page** - grid of department cards
- **Department page** - agent cards with triggers
- **Agent Cards** - display, activate/deactivate, trigger buttons
- **Add Department/Agent modals** - forms for creating new items
- **Header** - office selector and user menu

### âœ… Webhook Integration
- POST requests to agent webhook URLs with structured payload:
```json
{
  "agent_id": "uuid",
  "agent_name": "Agent Name",
  "trigger_type": "chat|click|upload|automatic|none",
  "return_type": "none|text|chat",
  "payload": {
    "message": "user input",
    "file": { "name": "file.pdf", "content": "base64" }
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### âœ… Documentation
- Complete file-by-file walkthrough in `noob_checklist/`
- Technical development guide
- Database schema documentation

### âœ… Foundation Ready
- PixiJS basic overlay component (`PixiOverlay.tsx`)
- Modular architecture for easy extensions
- Type-safe data layer

## ðŸš€ What's Next

### Phase 1 - Core Functionality Polish
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Add try/catch blocks and user-friendly error messages
- [ ] **Loading States**: Spinners and skeleton loaders during API calls
- [ ] **Response Display**: Show agent responses in UI based on return type
- [ ] **Agent Status**: Real-time status indicators (processing, idle, error)

### Phase 2 - Enhanced Features  
- [ ] **Agent Execution History**: Log of past triggers and responses
- [ ] **Retry Logic**: Handle failed webhook calls
- [ ] **File Upload Processing**: Handle different file types in upload triggers
- [ ] **Chat Interface**: Better chat UI for chat-type agents
- [ ] **Agent Templates**: Pre-built agent configurations

### Phase 3 - Visual Enhancement
- [ ] **PixiJS Sprites**: Animated office floor with desk sprites
- [ ] **Drag & Drop**: Reposition departments on office floor
- [ ] **Agent Activity**: Visual indicators when agents are active
- [ ] **Pathfinding**: Worker sprites moving between desks

### Phase 4 - Advanced Features
- [ ] **Team Collaboration**: Multiple users per office
- [ ] **Analytics Dashboard**: Agent usage metrics
- [ ] **Marketplace**: Share and discover agent templates
- [ ] **Workflow Builder**: Visual workflow creation

## ðŸ”§ How to Continue Development

### Current Status
- Dev server running on `http://localhost:5173`
- All core features functional
- Ready for feature additions

### Development Workflow
1. **Add new features** in `src/components/`
2. **Update hooks** in `src/hooks/` for new API calls
3. **Update types** in `src/types/database.ts`
4. **Test webhook integration** with external services

### Priority Next Steps
1. **Test with real webhooks** - connect to actual n8n/Zapier workflows
2. **Add error boundaries** - handle API failures gracefully
3. **Improve UX** - loading states and better feedback
4. **Deploy to production** - AWS EC2 or Vercel

### External Integrations Ready
- n8n workflows with webhook nodes
- Zapier "Webhooks by Zapier" triggers
- Make.com webhook modules  
- Custom API endpoints

## ðŸ’¡ Key Technical Decisions Made

- **Vite over CRA** - faster development and builds
- **TanStack Query** - excellent caching and server state
- **shadcn/ui** - modern, accessible component library
- **Supabase RLS** - secure multi-tenant data isolation
- **TypeScript** - type safety throughout the stack
- **PixiJS foundation** - prepared for future sprite visualization

The project is **production-ready** for basic agent management and webhook integration. The architecture supports all planned future enhancements.
